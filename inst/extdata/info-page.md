# CEQ Tool for Georgia


Welcome to the Fiscal simulation tool for Georgia prepared by the World Bank South Caucuses Poverty team with support from Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency. We are grateful for the data provided by National Statistics Office of Georgia. 

This fiscal simulation tool is based on the Fiscal Incidence Analysis (FIA) for Georgia by applying the Commitment to Equity (CEQ) methodology. FIA is designed to serve as a baseline for evaluation of the fiscal policy and potential policy reforms for fiscal equity and sustainability. The Commitment to Equity (CEQ) methodology is a rigorous and standardized fiscal incidence methodology that allows systematic analysis of the distributional impact of taxes and public spending using a common framework. It has been applied to more than 90 countries globally. More details on the methodology can be found in [CEQ Handbook 2022](https://commitmentoequity.org/). The equity aspect of fiscal policy is critical to informing [Sustainable Development Goals Indicator 10.4.2](https://sdg-indikatoren.de/en/10-4-2/), which measures the redistributive impact of the fiscal system on inequality reduction. 


The CEQ analysis for Georgia is based on macro-fiscal, administrative, and nationally representative household survey data for the fiscal year 2022. The tool simulates the impact of the fiscal interventions such as direct taxes, indirect taxes, direct transfers, indirect subsidies and in-kind transfers (education and health) on poverty and inequality in Georgia. Results from the analysis indicated that overall Georgia’s fiscal policies for the year 2022 are progressive, serving to reduce income inequality and poverty. The national poverty headcount decreased by 17.1 percentage points and inequality was reduced by 20 Gini points (from 44.7 at market income to 24.6 at final income). Default policy choice for the microsimulation tool is prevalent fiscal system for the year 2022.

Detailed results can be found in the paper “Georgia Fiscal Incidence Analysis” World Bank Report (2024) [forthcoming].
